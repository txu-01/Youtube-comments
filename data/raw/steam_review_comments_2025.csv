I have an idea that could bring a new level of excitement to GTA 6: a mode inspired by Undead Nightmare.  Imagine Vice City or Miami transformed into a zombie-infested zone, with survival missions, custom weapons, evolving characters, and an online mode where players face off as humans vs. enhanced zombies. It would be a mix of horror, action, and drama‚Äîcrafted with your signature Rockstar style.  I'm sharing this idea out of pure passion and creativity. You build legends, and I just want to add a spark to the fire.",618,107

Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 took around 6 years. Baldur's Gate 3 took around 7 years. Helldivers took around 8 years. Lethal Company took around 10 years. Elden Ring took around 5 years. The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild took around 5 years. Anthem based on dev took around 2 years. Mindseye took around 2 years. New World took around 5 years. Cyberpunk 2077 took around 4 years. Fallout 76 took around 4 years. Star Citizen has been in development for 15 years.  What can we conclude? It takes around 7 years to make a game if we take game like No Man's Sky which was in development for around 5 years and consider they spend several years making it great we can conclude the 7 years is great example. Anthem which technically took 7 years clearly needed few years more if we consider E3 2017 as the time when they started making the game they needed at least 3 more years to make it good which looking at Anthem 2.0 looked to be the case but they closed the game.  a lot of games that come out rushed have 5 years or less development time and a lot of games that are great spend 5 years or more making the game. Triple A Publishers want to release game in 2 years and assume you can get that all done by hiring 10 times more devs but adding more devs does not mean the game gets done faster which they refused to accept.  Yes, you can make great game in 1 year but that would be exception which confirms the norm. I strongly believe games take roughly 7 years to make 5 at minimum and 10 at most with exceptions like Star Citizen which is suffering from feature bloat.",1620,307

You‚Äôre thinking of the ones beforehand which would have the worst plastic, and not enough in terms of cooling. Lots of them are better than previous years, cuz now we don‚Äôt have laptops with one fan across the CPU and GPU for low end parts. Don‚Äôt even mention throttling though, that‚Äôs always been a safeguard to prevent a system from literally destroying itself. The whole deal with cooling is due to the limited form factor, while desktop PCs have plenty of room for cooling, even to a point where you can cool the thing down to 30 Celsius or less. That simply can‚Äôt happen with laptops unless there is three fans each for the CPU and GPU, which might make the system be designed bigger or reduce certain things. Besides that, the issue with fixing laptops like these isn‚Äôt that hard, the difficulties come from available parts, and the fact each laptop can be unique. The ease of repairability for desktops is due to the fact everything is standardized. Also there is no way you suggested a Framework laptop. Even the cheapest one with an i3-1315U is about 1000 CAD, a laptop that should be 550CAD max considering the price. Even their minimum configuration with a GPU costs over 2000CAD.",1248,221

If you take care of it, and it makes it through the first 3~+ years of life unscathed it should continue for quite a while. Same goes for ASUS if you are careful but don't get quite the same level of support if something does go sideways.  MSI I have always had mixed feeling about. Reasonably good bang for the buck on paper, but I can't say I have ever been impressed with their build quality nor long term reliability since they seem to go through their designs and model offerings like a pack of Costco Socks.  EVGA had a few nice attempts but sadly came and went so fast that there is nothing to talk about with them even though their build quality was excellent if a bit strange on their port selection and placement.  Framework really is going to be the disruptor here as you can fix/replace anything that fails and hopefully in time, get all sorts of custom options without having to fork out for a single spec you are stuck with that may/may not have everything you wanted. Hopefully their success leads to having a ton of optional upgrades and maybe even some other outside offerings can come in as well. Guess we will see.",1275,234

It's also kind of a shitshow to set up things if you aren't used to Linux (although you should really learn if you aren't).  TBH, I don't find neither that appealing RN. The Steam deck is theoretically made to run 7th gens games and below and 8th gen games at medium settings at 40 fps. I don't really see the appeal without a generational upgrade that patches those into high settings and 60 fps for 8th genband allows better interface for better enhancements in lower gens. Since otherwise you are just playing mostly indies and older game rereleases. And at that point I would just get a switch and and if you really want something like emulators mod it for similar features and the Nintendo first party output. Which is honestly a better sell than the Steam Deck atm. You don't even need to use emulators for most games, you can just buy digital rereleases and these often come with gyro support build it which is also on the deck but you have to set it up yourself through Steam imput.  Respect Switch 2, it's pretty much just a Switch 1 with massive performance boost. Which basically trumps the advantages in the Steam Deck use to have in the games they share and have proper 1440p and 4k support through DLSS upscaling.  However, the Switch 2 games are a joke, but with game key cards making non first party output even more pointless than it already was. And the first party output is too early to make up for it.   So rn, I would say Switch 1 or even 2 is a better deal than the Deck, but that's because of how rocky it's OS is in it's current state and how the hardware was getting closer but not fully there for what they were aiming for.  A Steam Deck 2 which Valve is waiting for a proper generational jump to commit to can deliver the performance I mentioned before would absolutely smoke the Switch 2. Finally having the power to deliver the experience they always promised and likely with an Oled model from the get go.   I am probably over ranting on a 1 minute shitpost but I felt like doing it so I will anyway.",2123,394

Dont know if so y has them but they should so you could finish a game on pc that you stsrted on ps5. Maybe they will go that way eventually since no native handheld anytime soon. Thags my biggest gripe with Nintendo is you cant sync save files thru multiple systems. There system is awful for more than one switch. Maybe cload save works idk cus it cost extrs just flr saves.,464,89

Anyways...  I'm glad Microsoft is trying to put in this effort, it took awhile, as there has many so many handheld Windows gaming PCs, which just didn't give a great experience, so naturally another company stepped up to base, Valve.  I'm curious on how well this will sell, as a hardcore performance PC gamer friend of mine, he refuses to buy the SteamDeck, but after this was announced, it was literally the first conversation we had, he's excited for it.  From this social interaction, I feel like this handheld might actually sell better than most people might expect, as both the Microsoft and XBox branding is in full effect, which a lot of hard-core gamers seen to have respect in.  I'd also be curious if SteamOS will be installable, or if since this is a Microsoft partner device, if they will lock down UEFI and SecureBoot making it impossible to load any other operating systems, as I'm sure super dedicated SteamOS and Linux users will try to install it on this device just to compare and potentially brag about some of the differences.  Does this new XBox handheld do game suspends and resumes like the SteamDeck?  As to me, that is a killer feature of SteamOS, as no other PC gaming system can suspend and resume so effortlessly like a video console, it feels almost magical to suspend a full PC game like that.  I do like the task switcher on this OS verses the more clunky one SteamOS has, so perhaps this release will further push Valve to improve SteamOS, as now OEMs have other choices, and if anyone knows Microsoft, they tend to get along with OEMs better than any other company.  Valve should really be watching this release very closely, as some of the feature sets are a bit better just from watching this video.",1853,330

I‚Äôm sure the lower end one at 720p is going to cost more than the Switch 2. My guess is at least $500 if we‚Äôre lucky. So where does that put the upgraded version. It‚Äôs almost a whole different console. Is that one gonna be like $800?,703,143

Sure, it's not easy to develop something like that, but it's also not impossible. Who wants shitty car driving in a game like this? That's a totally wasted development time. I want to be a ""god"" watching over a bunch of characters and nudge them to do things, help them along as they get older, maybe see them through some neigbor feuds and things like that. Go through realistic experiences with them. Watch as two families gradually start disliking each other and either nudge them to reconcile or instead throw more fuel into the fire. Someone maybe have a trauma that then influences their character. Until someone makes something like that, I'm not touching games like these.

I'd be interested in if they could have a gamemode that could use ai to direct the world rather then you yourself. Unique and exciting events would make inzoi different from the sims where no game can be played the exact same. Don't want ai voices, but behaviors and events to make the gameplay unexpected and at times challenging, would make the game more interesting. With ai, characters could make unique products and on somedays, your favorite store could be put out of business. The less control anyone has in the game's world building, the more expansive it could be. Also allowing the characters to have personal interests could mean that outside your control, your character may prefer one restaurant or clothing brand more than the other. This could result in a negative mood if they don't get what they want. A good realistic system requires discomfort outside the control of the player. If there was an option for an automated game world run by ai pathing, I believe the game could stand out more in comparison to better known games such as the Sims.",1137,199

He had a cold but wanted to go to a Internet Cafe and I had to cancel the it about 4x in one day cause he kept trying to go.

As an example, in Sims 2 there was a guy who was cheating on his wife with the maid and they started you off with that, it was all very human, but InZOI just feels too clean... its like a place Captain Kirk would visit in Startrek, like some world that looks creeply perfect on the surface but deep down there is somthing worng with it. It could also be the slightly uncanny graphics that while better for me make it look unnerving in some ways, or the fact that Korea is hyper conservative so they cant really have and displays of human weakness in the game.   I know you can run kids over and cheat and stuff like that, but Sims 2 at lest felt like the game was designed to lure you into doing things like that, I guess Sims 2 is a test of human character but InZOI is a depiction of perfect human character, the only bad stuff you can do being things the devs forgot to stop you from doing.  Though, as a note, I understand alot of LGBT stuff is coming to the game, if somehow a dev reads this I would every much enjoy it if the controls that govern the population on that were placed in player hands... for... fun reasions >:) In fact all controls relating to the behaviour of the general population would be a lot of fun to play with.",1396,271

I would buy her DLC's for Sims 4 occasionally and helped her mod it but she recently kind of lost interest. I had been keeping an eye on inZoi and the other Sims competitior (I forget the name and I think it was a total dud on release iirc) because I think she'd really enjoy something familiar but different. I'm very happy that inZoi looks like something that she would enjoy. I know that it needs a ton of work but it has so much potential. Apparently the devs removed Denuvo after player backlash so it seems that the devs actually care and are willing to take feedback. I hope they continue to work on it and make an amazing game. I mostly care so my girlfriend has a game she enjoys but I also care because I used to love the Sims and the Sims 2 when I was a kid! They were some of the only games that ran on my crappy PC so I played them all the time.

The focus shifted from telling meaningful stories, having meaningful gameplay based around the sims, their personalities and lives to this kind of soulless, meandering environment simulator. Basically these games all lack the heart that Sims 1 and 2 had and as long as these games try to cater to the masses by being as bland and customisable as possible, they will inevitably just appeal to casual players and aesthetes who just enjoy the visual and building aspects.   Sims 1 and 2 just had this unique quirkiness, depth and shock factor that is completely lacking now. It was depth focused over breadth. Nobody complained about closed worlds until we were spoiled with the prospect of open worlds but it came at the cost of becoming feature heavy yet lacking inner complexity. Think about the memory system of Sims 2.   Inzoi looks like it‚Äôs all flash but no substance. I would take a game that had 1/10th of the features presented here just to have zois who were animated, lively and dynamic instead. Why should we care more about how we can manipulate the appearance of the environments or drive cars if the zois themselves are utterly boring and devoid of the spark that makes them human and relatable?  I wish a game developer company would dare to make a spiritual successor to the early sims games that had a specific vision for the characters lives, rather than trying to garner as much mass appeal with the bells and whistles of ever expanding novel but ultimately useless features. Willing to sacrifice broad appeal for uniqueness and maybe even political incorrectness! But we seem to live in sanitised times where games like Sims 1 and 2 couldn‚Äôt be made anymore because we‚Äôre too preoccupied with trying to make everyone happy and aren‚Äôt willing to take risks and step on toes to make something truly innovating and inspiring.",1971,338

Surprised people are even talking about it, much less actually buying into it. Star Citizen is more finished and probably has more of a chance of getting finished than this. Another case of promising the world and delivering nothing but bugs, all while wasting all resources on unnecessarily photo realistic graphics. Yeah, the character creator is cool. So what? Kind of need to have a proper game to play with that character you create. Of course literally all the praise is empty copium of ""oh this is in early access though, come on guys, just trust with all your heart that the devs will totally finish this"" or nonsense like ""buy it to stick it to EA!"" Like what even? Nobody has anything useful to say about the game itself that shows it can stand on its own 2 legs.

Nowadays reviews are written by political activists who failed to land a job at a more mainstream publication, so they settled with writing about their politics in gaming magazines. Their reviews have 0 value and that is before you get to the obvious and well known fact that that these ""reviewers"" often get paid to give better reviews or do so because their publication is afraid they will no longer get early access to games anymore if they rate something bad.  A game like Silksong does not need the approval of industry shills like IGN or Gamespot.

That's a big reason why review codes and embargos exist. So they can complete the whole proccess withim normal working hours. No review codes, especially for a big release like this, means they will have crazy work hours  and will race to put out a review as soon as possible, even if it hurts the quality. (And their sleep schedules. ^^;)  That aside... I'm obviously not saying this is the case for team Cherry, but when a triple AAA dev refuses to give review codes or plave they an embargo until the game is release, it's usually a red flag. (Typically, the game is not ready for release, or it's just crap, and they hope to sell as many pre-orders and day 1 purchases before people become aware of a game's flaws.)  In Silksong's case the game is great, but... I don't think is a practice that should be celebrated. Distributing review codes (noth to traditional journalists and internet content creators) is generally a good practice.",1123,202

I'm not wasting my money on a game if it's a downgrade of the games that came before it. That's the whole reason you shouldn't pre-order games either because why should you give a company money for a product that is unreleased and unproven?

I do mean.. NEVER comes to the public or the consumers!! At which point does the lies become absolute misrepresentation and fraud?? Then the YouTube Content Creators get to play on a test branch and they literally never get or chose to play with us public folk on the servers we are ever on!! So what they present is not what comes down the pipeline to the public or us!! Then we are given a game which has so many game breaking bugs, issues and problems because those 'testers' are never doing their freaking jobs!! They play in their own special isolated server.. get given perks and rewards for their 'early access'.. lie to us about the game and what it is as the public does not have that access and at the end they are too busy making content for their YouTube Channels they failed to test the product and so what comes down the pipeline to the public is so broken it becomes a joke!!  Like this game has had 2 titles and three versions.. Primal Carnage: Genesis (that all fell apart because of the top dirty dev and his bad attitude).. The Isle: Legacy (dropped by the dirty devs who did not know what they were doing with the game code) and The Isle: Recode (delivered to the public with the slowest drip feed of features, content and creatures with constant game breaking issues & bugs)!! Taking the fact The Isle was once Primary Carnage: Genesis into account at one point.. this whole 'game' has been in development for 15-20 years!! I personally quit The Isle and I might come back every 1-2 years to see if anything has changed!! When I do come back all I find is the same mess, the same dirty devs, the same lies and missing promised content and a broken and incomplete version of the game!!  If I want to play a dinosaur game then it has to be Path of Titans which has a complete game and a full roster of dinosaurs!! Those decent devs split off from the dirty devs of The Isle and they made their complete game and dinosaur roster in a fraction of the time it has taken the dirty devs of The Isle to make their mess of a game and a product!! I personally gave up on The Isle ever being complete or finished!! It is clear the lead dirty dev wants to make a Jurassic Park survival horror KO and we paid for it to happen and the money went elsewhere!! Sadly Path of Titans is not a survival horror with dinosaurs as I would call it a survival adventure game with dinosaurs!!  Like the only thing I have come to expect out of The Isle is constantly being let down, lied to and seeing what the public will get being misrepresented by those who support (as YouTube Content Creators in their special testing server) or are making the game as dirty devs!! I personally think The Isle should be removed from the Steam Store as it was and always has been a scam and the public won't ever get what we have been promised!! I also don't think The Isle will ever be finished either and if the project is to be saved it needs to be given.. in full.. to decent devs who will deliver what they promise but also finish what they start!!",3131,590

To me the isle, it is just bad. some may like it, that's fine and all but that is just my opinion.  To top it all off as well, to me the dinos they added is just ... yikes. It all seems like a copy paste from legacy they abandoned with slight tweaks. I expected stego, trike or for example t-rex (what will not come out until 2026 ... xD) to look different ... to move different but it doesn't... Trike looks like a oversized Dachshund... Stego looks like it has something up its butt and T-rex (as from videos i seen) looks to me like a weird penguin. On top of that the bias for playing carnivoires, it is just sad. There is AI to hunt and all but the adult raptor rather hunts and eats you as a juvie dino instead of a boar what would give them more xD  Overall, to me its just sad seeing them to screw and trash their own game with force adding new stuff, make it all honky dory and hype to the players but completely f**k up their game with other stuff they should fix with priority.  As said above the fish issue, it literally makes a lot of species that rely on them unplayable tbh.",1523,297

I think I have an idea. If they had servers based on resources rather than players, that might work. If you went to play the game and said I want to play dinosuchus, it would put you on a server with more available resource slots. If you want to play a smaller species? It would put you onto a server that only has small amounts of resource slots. That might just work for balancing resources in the game. Okay, now on to the original reply. Describe the game in one word. Incomplete. I'm going to play Devil's advocate for a second, but before I do I want to say I agree with nearly every single point you make. So, you're talking about this game, but! You are talking about the beta for the new version. When you download the game on Steam you are greeted with the original version with tutorials. You have to opt in for the beta to get the better game. The game everyone is playing. So of course you do..... You go into the beta leaving the original behind. And you skip all the tutorials. It's my belief that the devs intend players to play the original game with tutorials before getting into the beta. However! I agree with you. That's so much has changed that even tutorials wouldn't explain it to new players, or players who have played the original game. Look, I love the game it but I have been playing it for a while. I have never read a Dev release, I've never watched a how to or anything like that. But I'm not most people. Most people get into this game, they hear about the beta, they get into the beta, and there is no information on what to do. I think that's the biggest problem. If there were proper tutorials, a more reliable map system, and yes, I understand they want to make things more realistic by not having one, but this is a game! Games are meant to be fun! Not work. What was I saying? I don't know anymore.... I'm going to leave at that! I love your video, I agree with a lot of your points. I disagree with a couple. Keep up the good work!",2025,388

I couldn't find any food anywhere - spent hours wandering around starving to death. The servers were practically empty with almost no other players to interact with, making the whole experience feel lonely and pointless. My gameplay consisted entirely of dying, respawning, and running toward migration spots that usually turned out to be empty or useless.  The lack of meaningful progression was incredibly frustrating - there's no sense of achievement or growth, just endless cycles of survival that lead nowhere. Every session ended in frustration rather than enjoyment. The encounters with other dinosaurs were rare and when they did happen, they were usually brief and unsatisfying due to the clunky mechanics and poor balance.  This video perfectly captures why I gave up on this game after wasting too many hours hoping it would get better.

I don't mind struggling but I need some north star to aim towards, without that I just concluded that this is a boring game where nothing happens and you just eat grass and die.

Never new the personal backstory of the team. Tho new that Dondi had a bit of an attitude XD  What I critique about this is the bashing of 'now adding humans',,,, eeeem that's been the plan since it's launch. The Isle was always planned to have 3 factions, one being dinosaurs. The 2nd humans and 3rd being Cannibals (aka Tribal). With that alien huminoid you've shown, always being a mystery, coz from what I remember, it isent part of the 3.  To any that read this if you go looking you'll find VERY old concept art for them and even the ability to ride these dinosaurs, the human faction you pick determining if you could ride most the dino's or not. Along with old animations and sketchs for the alien humanoid thing.  I know many enjoy The Isle for being a good dino game, but this has always been planned. And I cant wait to go tribal, even if it takes another 10 years, just so I can jump on with my mates, and be scaried shitless of some dino appearing out of the bushes and munching on me.

A vaguely humanoid that May be able to stand toe to toe with some dinos, it's lowkey perfect instead of adding Normal call of duty shoot a man type guys to the Isle. The shiesty, half baked, retconned to hell, miniscule amounts of lore we got for the Ilse DOES feature Apollo? I think was the research company or whatever having made replicators, these big machines that clone and birth the dinosaurs going out of wack and creating things like that. it's honestly a cool idea. Pretty sure it's also where the whole idea for mutations NOT Elders, But the Hyper, Neruo and Tisso strains came from. Which who in the hell knows if that will ever come or if it's even still on the table let alone canon.  when I started playing the Isle when it fresh released I bought it because it wasn't just a Survival Horror, No. It was Sci-fi horror, so many ideas on the table of intrigue and mystery with Apollo, knowing that under the surface wasn't JUST a dino game. It was the enigmatic and unethical science being produced. They brought back Dinosaurs for whatever reason and then Apollo sought ever after higher more depraved science, the creation of manmade horrors like the Cannibals/Mutant tribals mixtures of dino DNA and rampant forced evolution for god knows what purpose, All of it was SO GODDAMN GOOD and yet... It's basically all thrown out or at the very least so far on the back burner it's being eaten by roaches.",1628,290

About a game that I loved and grew up admiring its game ever since it step foot in existence. I have seen a few videos that have explained why the Isle is a terrible game. But even they combined cant match, the details Zenny has done. Which is very commendable, because a lot of what you have mentioned are topics that I have gone through but never took notice of it because I assumed that I am expected to find all this information out myself.  You have pointed out the flaws the game has, which can be fixed but seems like in the eyes of Dondi there is no flaw.   I do love this game, but heck. Those who play the Isle, really do reflect on the time you use on the game. I have 3998 hours in the Isle, that is nearly 167 days worth of playing a video game that doesn't save any hard progress you put, lots of players I know would disagree and wouldn't mind. I know some who have 5000+ hours in the game. It may not sound much, but that is actually a big portion of your life.  This video is an hour long, but it is 100% worth watching. (Make me wonder how much time you put in this video XD)  I remember when I first played the Isle back in 2022 for my first time. I had no idea what I was doing, I had no one to provide me support on what you are suppose to do in this game. I still remember, but I spent 3 weeks worth of time playing the game until I naturally understood on what I needed to do. (Bear in mind, I mean 3 weeks of me just walking around, finding food, finding diets. Dying, starving, falling. It was just me flushing time down the toilet.)  Makes me wonder about The Isle's future though, I do not even play Path of Titans mainly because it is difficult to even find, I do not know if I am looking in the wrong places. Doesn't matter, back to the Isle. What will happen to the Isle 2 years from now? I mean currently the Trike has been released, Rex and Allo are about to be released at the end of the month.

For a recent example, look at Space Engineers and Space Engineers 2.  Space Engineers 1 came out with EA on 12/15/2016, 14 days after the Isle's initial release date for EA. Since then, Space Engineers fully released and now have a working EA for their second game while continuously updating SE1.  SE2 also has a new engine involved, which they made.

I was kinda thinking at first when I saw Summit1g's thoughts on the game after a week or two of him playing were a bit extreme but this video reminded me of the hatred I had for this game. One time, I got my dino stuck in a building and when shit like this happens, discord admins are supposed to help you get unstuck, turns out the only unstuck part they were helping you with is if you got stuck in a tree or a hole. They had a rule where it said that it is your fault for exploring the buildings so if you get stuck in there, say goodbye. As if I wasn't angry enough with this game, the admins had to be buttholes and punish the players for the developers' mistakes. Thankfully, they finally made the /unstuck command but apparently it only works when there are no players near you. Idk, I kinda gave up on the game since there isn't anything fun... because they took that out of the game to make it more ''realistic''.     Update 3 and 4 still are the best updates this game's ever had. Mostly because of the map. And it all went downhill since update 5.  I mean..

'BOUT MADE ME CRY. _BUDDY._ That's a whole ass mood.  I'm so happy that so much of this video was about the map. The fact that the map is so enormous while having so few people is a crime. I also read that AI only spawns when a certain number of people are in the region. (More people visit, more AI spawn) So, if fish are spawning in the river, you know people are around. That's something I learned from posts that were 2, 4, 6 years old on Reddit. _Reddit._ Not in-game, Reddit. I died like three times on a deino at that point, and now I was at ~45% growth and 0% diet 'cause I was playing solo. Yeah... they really need to change how the AI works. Solo isn't viable, and that's a load of absolute crap when you're on a map of that size with random spawns. Also, I'll never understand how people say the game is scary. The dark isn't scary, it's annoying. ""Oh no, I can't see, what if there are monsters."" Yeah, well, if I die, I won't see it coming, so whatever, kill me, I guess. I'll wake up and still be blind.

My first three attempts at life ended with me starving to death while trying to look for something to eat.   I spent pretty much all of my first two lives figuring out the controls and interfaces, while starving.  Third life, figure stuff out as my crea, finally find food and get stalking and hunting down aaaaaand instantly get blindsided by a herbivore player, a Paci, i think, considering it headbutted me to death.  All that took about 2 hoursish  My honest thoughts so far is that its a good idea of a game, and it have a great game in its heart but its buried deep under a mound of truly baffling decisions, like migration zones. And the map feels so cluttered, yet so empty. Which is such a contradictory feat that I am frankly impressed.  I also agree that the prevalence of small dinos that do nothing to the food chain, is a chain to the games longevity.  I feel they need to focus more on expanding their medium sized dino roster. But also give some love to carnivores as it is an up hill struggle for them (except the damn croc) maybe add an apex predator to the game, doesn't have to be a Rex, could be an Allosaurus or maybe give the spotlight to another lesser known Thropod. Something that would give the carnivorous the edge.  Also increase the server capacity, 100 is way too small for the size of map",1427,265

You might be right about there being a lot of bad game design, but that doesn't mean the game is no longer fun.  I've been addicted to this game since I started playing it. I see other people in this comment section talking about how the ""community is dead"" and ""there's rarely any other players around,"" but that hasn't been my experience at all. Perhaps that's because I joined a very populated and friendly community server. There's always hundreds of players online at any given time, and because it's so populated, I encounter other players constantly. Due to the high player count, the server owners had to disable the npc animals. Even so, due to a well-balanced diversity of dinos on this server (and large total population), there's still plenty of opportunities for carnivores to get food. The server owners also take steps to balance the distribution of dinos and their behavior so bad actors can't egregiously disadvantage other players.  I only play Hypsilophodon, and I've been able to reach full-grown (well, reaching full-grown as a hypsil is easy, tbf) and nest multiple times. It doesn't take long for other players to hatch from my eggs, either. The same goes for groups I've been in where other Hypsils are the ones nesting. For me, the nesting experience hasn't been miserable at all. If anything, I'm appreciative of its realism. Animals irl have to deal with the vulnerability of limited food and safety when nesting.  It might be that being a part of a good server has made my experience vastly different from other players. I actually attempted The Isle years ago and had a terrible time with it; with both the game and the community. The game didn't explain anything (which is still an issue today), and the community was so unfriendly and unwelcoming that no one was willing to teach me anything either. It was only after recently seeing The Isle videos pop up on my feed that I became interested again. And this time around, other players were kind enough to help me when I was struggling, which also made me more willing to put more effort into learning more about the game myself.  With all the flaws and bad development choices currently plaguing The Isle, it's still one of my favorite games at the moment.",2416,423

With every product comes a target audience with the starting point of your own interest. You have an interest, inconvenience, something that warrants you to create for a larger audience so not only you can enjoy it, but everyone else. The Isle developers sadly take away that factor and cater to a very small population of the community that is agreeable with their decisions or an even smaller part of the community that complains the loudest. They ignore the rest of the audience, the real market, and then wonder why their game hits low player count or runs into issues such as losing once loyal players that they once had at the start. This issue exceeds their map design, but their decision making with certain playables such as making dilo as strong as it is due to a certain developer favoritism. Or how raptor faced numerous nerfs due to how popular the playable is and forcing the community to play other animals far more ‚Äúdesirable‚Äù due to their vastly more extensive kit or other reasons. I remember when raptor players took many hits, from it being mostly skill based with little luck to it being a whole lot of luck with skill assisting as crutches. I believe it‚Äôs at a decent place, but not nearly as good as it could be. Stamina is still a fairly large issue for the animal despite it being an ambush and pursuit predator, but lacks the sprint boost and, due to the stamina changes, can barely pursuit until 50% stam before needing to pull off. It‚Äôs a bit disappointing to see how many memories were made during Legacy and Spiro days, but how off-putting Evrima has become. I remember camping and spam joining servers that had over 300+ people joining at a time. Now the thought of logging on feels draining in it of itself.",1862,334

I started playing during Isle_Region2 days. When you spawned you HAD to run to a watersource immediately or you would desiccate. This was when, when you first spawned you started with like 0% thirst. It was a bug, but it was brutal for a first impression. I've lost more baby dinos in those days than i think some players have even seen. I didnt have a fullgrown adult until Thenyaw released. That's when i started REALLY playing the Isle. Like, core group of 4 allo mains killing absolutely everything. Really great times. I'm in one of Anths videos so that kinda dates the period in time.   I pretty much stopped playing when Envirma was pushed to the forefront and I couldn't play it. The update in Legacy with nighttime that just straight up blinded you was not fun. I have a new computer now, but I'm not really interested in Envirma as it is, I agree entirely with the dino-size criticism. Tiny dinos should not be a playable, they are redundant and were a development manpower sink. They have 4 kinds of tiny dino whose gameplay loop is essentially the same. I think they need to fast track in the dinos people want to play, THEN add in mechanics. They have a 1/4 of their planned dinos in the game and they add mechanics that don't really add value. Just... add all the dinos- then add in the mechanics and balance; rinse repeat.",1373,250

It doesn't hold the hand of new users like Pot. Games that do this in my opinion are ridiculous. You have to fight to survive in a survival game.

This video seemed like it was made to praise Pot, but Pot is not a good game. Dinosaur games are not easy in my opinion. Survival games may be easy, but they can never be made easier. Also, I agree with you on one thing. The game is still in early access, but it's definitely more playable than Pot. You might call it a fanboy now, but listen, Pot only has a variety of dinosaurs and it's too childish to be a dinosaur game. There's almost no bloodshed. If The Isle were developed a little faster and more logically, I'm sure it would be the best dinosaur game. And again, is growing by picking flowers a feature that makes Pot bad? WTF is it, anyway? I won't criticize The Isle for its gameplay or anything like that, but when it comes to updates, I think the same thing.

When evrima released it was pretty unplayable so I didn't give it a good try until recently. This game is like a toxic relationship. The good about it is unique to it. The minimalist approach actually simulates an ecosystem fairly well. The direction they're taking and the unique playstyles they're giving to animals is adding to this game what it was missing in legacy. The playstyles are the gameloop, and your choice of dinosaur is vital to it. The graphics make sitting down after stressful gameplay and enjoying the moment really fulfilling. The animals have individual personality, and you learn about their behavior naturally with time. The game evolves with simple changes like species dependent night vision. All good if the game worked. All good if pvp wasn't laggy, or if your card could pull the graphics. Or if the map was traversable with your fragile bones. Losing hours of progress to natural means is frustrating but good, but it's awful when it's because of bs.

But after thinking about it more I realized that a game about surviving as a dinosaur for its own sake felt pointless and that no one would ever be interested in playing it so I just shelved the idea and moved on. So it's cool to see that games like The Isle do have enough of a player base to prove my idea really was viable and that other people do just want to experience the world through a dinosaur's eyes.

I've been playing since Legacy, and admin a (Previously very populated) server. I watched every painful step, and every poor choice. I saw the dedicated player base slowly lose interest after the maps were changed again and again while new playables were so delayed that by the time they showed up, players only returned to give it a try before uninstalling a week later due to game breaking bugs, no AI, and mechanics that were steadily getting worse and better at the same time.",514,90

I liked dino games but I never got into them much before. I found a community on PoT and it gave me the confidence to try the Isle: Evrima. I really like the Isle, the aesthetic of the game and UI, it's VERY different than PoT but I don't feel one is better than the other. It's honestly more of a point of preference and mood. Sometimes I wanna play path and pester people (positive and negeative) on my Rhamph and have a good time. (I even got my hubby to play with me, we had a great time!) And other times I want to play Isle: Evrima. I have a comfortable pvp server via Metta's Den and a pve server via Life Breaks Free. And even there I switch. It took me about 50 hours of nearly constantly dying and playing with nesting players, before I finally found a dino that works for me. I'm a Herra but not the usual kind. I'm a peaceful scavenger. I can't really do the combat. I'm visually impaired and the darker lighting in the game makes combat nearly impossible for me. But I do have fun snagging lil bites of food from other carnivores or especially fishing on my pve server. Keeping a dino alive is really a joy with how awful the AI has been recently >.< Especially as you can't seem to kill any of it as a baby.   BUT and to the reason for my comment. This video was very informative and I agree with your assessment. I want to be a youtuber but none of the content I could get was worth anything. It was just me rushing to find food and dying. Or accidently killing myself, like smashing a Ptera into a tree. Or falling off a cliff as a Maia, woops. It was frustrating and a fair let down and nesting can be hit or miss. I really love it but after we've grown up, everyone tends to log off or leave which is a bit disappointing.  My main complaint for the Isle is (AI of course) but mostly, I want to be able to have multiple dinos. I don't want to lose the perma-death. I love the thrill of that and I think that's too foundational of the game. But I tend to only play on one or two communities and nesting happens a ton on various dinos and that's one of my favorite experiences. I want to log off my Herra and go run around with Troodons for a bit. Or get in on a canni skin raptor pack. But when my kiddo is home and needy, I really would like to be able to switch back to my herra, scavange when he's content and be able to partially afk in a gorgeous thunderstorm while I talk to or help him with whatever is happening. I am also an avid writer and being able to focus on both like my brain demands is really good and I've gotten really happy. Most of the time I'm not even stealing from anyone. It's just an abandoned turtle in the forest along the coast. Or a chicken someone killed but could never find. I'm not intruding on anyone, or griefing. I get the lil terrifying interactions and feel good about being able to survive. (Not so much dying to random starvation for no reason, I really agree, I wish we had the old spiro map back, that looked amazing. Honestly half the reason herra is so damn useful is because I can scale over these intrusive mountains in between me and critical scarps.)  Overall though, it was great to get some background on the game and understand why some things the way they are. And I am kinda curious where human vs dino is gonna go.",3364,651

Many people play the Isle because they love dinos and want a dino simulator experience. I have played the isle for about 4 or 5 years and my thoughts on legacy and Evrima is: - To much time to grow a dino, some dinos are like 6-7hours to grow, and many times people die after 1-3h. -map is to big, we dont want a walk simulator, we wanto to ser other dinos, we want to herd, want to form groups. We are humans not dinos and we bring our biology to the game. Humans are social animale that need others to survive, thats natural to watch players forming groups to survive and stay in key places, we built cities near water we are not nomads we like to stay in a safe place with others, thats humans do so its hard to counter that. A huge map will be empty 99% of time. Servers with 100 people to a map that could have 1000 or more, the result is 99% of the map will be empty.  My opinion is have some good spots with lakes, with alot of food to haver herbs and carn going there to hunt. Make much smaller maps, make a few great places with alot of food for herbs and water. And make growth time a lot less, lile half to grow an apex or a huge herb.",1222,247

Like every single cooking recipe, it needs at least two ingredients: 2 stakes, 2 chicken, 2 berries, 2 pieces of everything, which makes no sense and is an unnecessary grind. Saying crafting isn't as grindy is also a lie. I never had to run back and forth as often in a survival game as I did here to simply build a house. Besides, the building of houses feels terrible without the ghost mode. If you equip a weapon and shield and switch to one of your tools and back, your shield is no longer equipped with your weapon, and you have to do it on your own. You can't use your scroll wheel to switch your tools. In the game, you have to eat and drink as your character is never saturated. Not only does the combat feel clunky, the overall movement and jumping feels pretty bad. 600 people worked on this project, and the animations look worse than the animations from solo devs. The weight system makes 0 sense. While you need wood the most, wood is 4 times heavier than stone and 20 times more different to get. While playing the game, half of it felt like a log-cutting simulator. In the first minute of the game, you learn how to use your crafting table and how to craft weapons and tools. After you do this, you get the same tools in the next quests again. Some of the icons also feel like the developers didn't even think the tiniest bit about their game. Like the exhaustion bar is an arm? What the hell? Most of the game literally feel like the devs haven't played their game a single time and just want to use the runescape IP to make a fast cash grab. Even if it is an early access and of course, it will have problems. This is the worst early access survival game out there. And they literally want 30‚Ç¨ from you to test their garbage",1869,356

Some things you didn't go into (because you probably didn't know about them in pre-release sneak peak)  - Requires EOS account to play 'with friends'. EOS being a potential roadblock to even playing the game with how many problems EOS has. - Some skill trees are non-existant outside of a basic attack, like magic. (Perhaps these will come as they flesh out a still combersome combat system?)

(Even better if they added gold to the game, obviously.) I can already foresee there being communities where people will make worlds people can join to trade rarer/harder to find items back and forth because you CAN take your entire inventory to a new world in multiplayer. Not your chests, but definitely your inventory. And that means you can help a friend just starting out to be more durable in the early game.

I understand it's going to attract a lot of players but reading comments like ""can we just get mana plz"" in Twitch chat is sad to see because Runescape helped inspire so many games and younger players won't care and essentially just want it to be Valheim or Enshrouded.

Do not try to explore, if you die you will have to claim your stuff and if you die agaian your stamina will be cut and after a while even your carryweight.
