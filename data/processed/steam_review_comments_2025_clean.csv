In my first game I type in chat saying it’s my first time playing this game and I was very confused with the mechanism. A very nice player teach me all the buttons and how the guns work. He didn’t fight me at all and just run around for me to practice shooting hahahaha. It was super wholesome. My bf has a different experience tho. He loves this game but his skill level is way higher than others and they keep saying that he’s cheating and most of them left the match lol.,501,98,I had the same experience!

There is a lot of potential in this game and with a good amount of optimizing and polishing and some game play tweaks this could be the Sims killer. I hate the fact my Zoi has to essentially do 2 things to eat and can't make a meal for a family , hate that Zoi's don't really want to have conversations and will walk off if you don't have stuff in your queue, there is no jealousy my Zoi can go from woman to woman and nothing negative happens.",

It took me a literal year after finally trying to figure it out since I spent a good 10 dollars on it, only to realize I was playing on the legacy version since installing it. Maybe I’m a bit slow, but this is is still such a dumbass way to make new players install your game... There were no prompts, and I don’t even think I found answers when I searched up why I didn’t have access to those dinosaurs.

I remember being a brand new isle player (still new cuz I haven’t touched the game since lolol) and I couldn’t figure out why my game didn’t look like all the cool yt videos or why I didn’t have all the dinosaurs that were added, esp deino.. It took me a literal year after finally trying to figure it out since I spent a good 10 dollars on it, only to realize I was playing on the legacy version since installing it. Maybe I’m a bit slow, but this is is still such a dumbass way to make new players install your game...

But after thinking about it more I realized that a game about surviving as a dinosaur for its own sake felt pointless and that no one would ever be interested in playing it so I just shelved the idea and moved on. So it's cool to see that games like The Isle do have enough of a player base to prove my idea really was viable and that other people do just want to experience the world through a dinosaur's eyes. Too bad about this one specific game though.,798,148,So the cool thing about The Isle was that I had a similar idea for a dinosaur based MMO that was just about surviving as a dinosaur where players would be either herbivores and group together for mutual survival or carnivores where they would play more solo style and hunt other players while defending their territory from other carnivores.
